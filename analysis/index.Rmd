### Strategy for analysis and visualization of Nezi Ovarian cancer dataset.


# Analysis

The different sub-populations in the analysis are identify as sensivie **(S)**, intermediate sensitive **(IS)** and resistant **(R)** based on the relapse time.

***

+ [T1 vs T2 comparison](T1_vs_T2_Perseus_imputation.html): all the possible combination between **T1** and **T2** populations.

+ [T1 vs TME1 comparison](T1_vs_TME1_Perseus_imputation.html): all the possible combination between **T1** and **TME1** populations.

+ [T2 vs TME2 comparison](T2_vs_TME2_Perseus_imputation.html): all the possible combination between **T2** and **TME2** populations.

### Old analysis integration 

in this analysis I combine the previeus results obtained form single patient comparison with the new strategy. 
It is now possible to observe the unique proteins within the differential analysis thanks to imputation.

+ [T1 vs T2](Integration_old_analysis.html): patients comparison in condition **T1** vs **T2**.

+ [T1 vs TME1](Integration_old_analysis_T1_TME1.html): patients comparison in condition **T1** vs **TME1**.

+ [T2 vs TME2](Integration_old_analysis_T2_TME2.html): patients comparison in condition **T2** vs **TME2**
